# Engineering Graphics Reverse Engineering Project

This is my final project for the class Engineering Graphics (EGME-1810). Using SolidWorks, I modeled the parts of a retractable ballpoint pen (a Paper Mate InkJoy ballpoint pen). Then, I created a complete set of working drawings from which the pen could be manufactured.
